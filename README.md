# SINES: Scripting, Inputs &amp; Nifty Eldritch Secrets!
>Scripting, Inputs & Nifty Eldritch Secrets is a curated compendium of useful links, tools, references, and write-ups for RA developers.

This repository collects unofficial knowledge, strange edge cases, dev made knick-knacks and practical techniques for retroachievements; the kind of stuff you usually only learn after summoning the wrong dæmon once or twice.


![Retro is forever](https://preview.redd.it/watch-frieren-this-is-not-a-suggestion-v0-3gbsk7cur88c1.jpeg?auto=webp&s=8087a13330e3298e10642165e652c63d9d6f406a "Retro is forever")

[Retroachievements](https://retroachievements.org/ "Retroachievements") is a website dedicated to add achievements to games, all for retro consoles. Yes, all of them, even that one. ~~You are old~~.

How to add stuff to the list or ask for changes? If you're a super advanced power-user, make a pull request (it's not that hard to learn) or else ping / DM Sines on discord.
